\begin{enumerate}
    \item % #1
        Consider the 2-pt boundary value problem:
        \begin{align*}
            -u'' = f(x)\text{ on } 0 < x < L \\
            u(0) = \alpha, \quad u'(L) = \sigma.
        \end{align*}
        Discretize this problem using the $O(h^2)$ central finite differences
        and a ghost point near $x = L$ to handle the Neumann boundary condition.
        Write out the resulting linear system.

    \item % #2
        Find the Green's function that satisfies:
        \[
            -G'' = \delta(x - \xi),\quad G(0;\xi) = 0,\quad G'(L;\xi) = 0.
        \]

    \item % #3
        Use the result from Problem 2 to write out the exact solution to the
        boundary value problem with general $f(x)$, $\alpha$, and $\sigma$.

    \item % #4
        Use the results from Problems 2 and 3 to find the exact inverse to the
        finite difference matrix found in Problem 1.

    \item % #5
        Use the result in Problem 4 to prove that the finite difference method
        in Problem 1 is $L_{\infty}$-stable.

    \item % #6
        Consider the uniform mesh $x_j = jh$ and let
        \[
            U_j = u(x_j) \quad \text{and} \quad W_j \approx u'(x_j).
        \]
        In standard finite differences, we typically find linear combinations
        of $U_j$ to define the approximation $W_i$ to $u'(x_j)$:
        \[
            W_i = \sum*{j}{}{\beta_j U_j}
        \]
        In compact finite differences we are allowed to generalize this to
        \[
            \sum*{j}{}{\alpha_j W_j} = \sum*{j}{}{\beta_j U_j}
        \]

        Find the compact finite difference with the optimal local truncation
        error that has the following form:
        \[
            \alpha W_{j-1} + W_j + \alpha W_{j+1} = \beta\p{\frac{U_{j+1} - U_{j-1}}{2h}}.
        \]

    \item % #7
        Consider Poisson's equation in 2D:
        \begin{align*}
            -u_{xx} - u_{yy} = f(x,y)\text{ in }\Omega = \br{0,1} \times \br{0,1}, \\
            u = g(x,y)\text{ on } \partial\Omega
        \end{align*}
        Discretize this equation using the 5-point Laplacian on a uniform mesh
        $\Delta x = \Delta y = h$.
        Use the standard natural row-wise ordering.

    \item % #8
        Write a MATLAB code that constructs the sparse coefficient matrix $A$
        and the appropriate right hand side vector $\v{F}$.

    \item % #9
        Using your code, do a numerical convergence study for the following
        right-hand side forcing and exact solution:
        \[
            f(x,y) = -1.25e^{x + .5y}\quad\text{and}\quad u(x,y) = e^{x + .5y}
        \]
        % use the backslash operator in MATLAB
